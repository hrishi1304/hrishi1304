ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Hrishi Patel!

ðŸŽ“ I hold a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication from Dharmsinh Desai University.

ðŸŒ± During my journey, I've gained a deep understanding of embedded devices, C programming, data structures, and Linux kernel programming. I'm also well-versed in C++, Yocto Buildsystem, Buildroot Buildsystem, MCU, RTOS, and Linux custom driver development.

ðŸ’¼ I've honed my skills through practical experience, including my internship at e-infochips, where I got hands-on experience with a wide range of technologies.

ðŸ”§ I'm comfortable working with tools like STMcubeIDE, CMake, and various build systems, ensuring efficient and effective development.

ðŸš€ Passionate about creating efficient and elegant solutions, I'm always excited to learn and collaborate on innovative projects in the world of embedded systems and software development.
